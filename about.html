	<div class="about">
		welcome to djandchill.club <br><br>
		looks like we can't go out for a while. <br><br>
		we hope that this can be a place for us all to virtualize our reality to maintain some semblance of normality during these trying times.<br><br>
		lets do humanity a favor and party from our livingrooms.<br>
		<br><br>
		our goal is to amplify the reach of musicians effected by the current global circumstance with the goal of compensation through tips (via twitch or venmo), and act as a simple and centralized platform for displaced ravers looking for an outlet that feels familiar while giving them the chance to directly support artists they care about from the comfort of...wherever they are.
		<br><br>
		see u on the dancefloor friends.
